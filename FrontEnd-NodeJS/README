Gived up play framework and switched to AngularJS, Node.js for the following reasons:

1. play does not integrate well with IDE
2. There are major changes between different version of play framework.
   It is being wasting time to try to find the solution for the correct version
3. Built-in web server is slow to start. Once started, laptop is in an very slow state,
   which is because my laptop only has 4GB memory and does not have SSD.


Procedures:

1. Create UI
2. User types query string which is converted to http GET request,like
   '/search?query=machine%20learning&format=html&numdocs=10&know=true&page=1'
3. node redirects this request to port 23456 to let java ServerSocket handle.
   returned results are documents.
4. controller handles returned documents and display href link, abstraction


Timeline:

4/23/2016
1. Finished frontend layout
2. Send request in the controller part is done

ToDo:
1. How http request is handled by the java code?
2. How to organize the structure of returned results?
